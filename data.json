Now, a series of alleged conversations between the Tesla CEO Elon Musk and top Twitter executives \u2013 founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey, former CEO Parag Agrawal and Bret Taylor- chair of Twitter's board of directors has appeared online. The alleged chat and email messages are shared by Internal Tech Emails on Twitter. Here's how things unfolded April 6, 2022 Elon Musk: I have a ton of ideas, but Imk if I'm pushing too hard. I just want Twitter to be maximum amazing. Parag Agrawal: I want to hear all the ideas - and I'll tell you which ones I'll make progress on vs. not. And why. Parag Agrawal: And in this phase \u2014 just good to spend as much time with you. + have my Product and Eng team talk to you to ingest information on both sides.

Elon Musk: I interface way better with engineers who are able to do hardcore programming than with program manager / MBA types of people. Parag Agrawal: in our next convo - treat me like an engineer instead of CEO and lets see where we get to. I'll know after that convo who might be the best engineer to connect you to. Elon Musk: Frankly, I hate doing mgmt stuff. I kinda don't think anyone should be the boss of anyone. But I love helping solve technical/product design problems. Elon Musk: You got it!

Wondering what may have happened next? Read on April 9, 2022 Parag Agrawal: You are free to tweet \"is Twitter dying?\" or anything else about Twitter - but it's my responsibility to tell you that it's not helping me make Twitter better in the current context. Next time we speak, I'd like to you provide you perspective on the level of internal distraction right now and how it hurting our ability to do work. I hope the AMA will help people get to know you, to understand why you believe in Twitter, and to trust you - and I'd like the company to get to a place where we are more resilient and don't get distracted, but we aren't there right now. Elon Musk: What did you get done this week? Elon Musk: I'm not joining the board. This is a waste of time. Elon Musk: Will make an offer to take Twitter private. A day later, Bret Taylor \u2013 former chair of Twitter's board of directors acknowledged Musk's conversation with Parag and responded back saying: April 10, 2022 Bret Taylor: Acknowledging your text with Parag yesterday that you are declining to join the board. This will be reflected in our 8-K tomorrow. I've asked our team to share a draft with your family office today. I'm looking forward to speaking today. Elon Musk: Sounds good Elon Musk: It is better, in my opinion, to take Twitter private, restructure and return to the public markets once that is done. That was also Jack's view when I talked to him. The conversation continues on April 13, 2022 as: Elon Musk: After several days of deliberation \u2014 this is obviously a matter of serious gravity \u2014 I have decided to move forward with taking Twitter private.

April 26, 2022 Jack Dorsey: I want to make sure Parag is doing everything possible to build towards your goals until close. He is really great at getting things done when tasked with specific direction. Would it make sense for me you and him to get on a call to discuss next steps and get really clear on what's needed? He'd be able to move fast and clear then. Everyone is aligned and this will help even more. Elon Musk: Sure Jack Dorsey: great when is best for you? And please let me know where/if you want my help. I just want to make this amazing and feel bound to it Elon Musk: How about 7pm Central? Elon Musk: Your help would be much appreciated Elon Musk: I agreed with everything you said to me Jack Dorsey: Great! Will set up. I won't let this fail and will do whatever it takes. Its too critical to humanity. Elon Musk: Absolutely Elon Musk: You and I are in complete agreement. Parag is just moving far too slowly and trying to please people who will not be happy no matter what he does. Jack Dorsey: At least it became clear that you can't work together. That was clarifying. Elon Musk: Yeah It is probably after this that Musk may have made up his mind to bring changes he made at Twitter on his first day of taking charge.

According to sources, CEO Parag Agrawal and CFO Ned Segal were 'escorted out\" of the social media company's San Francisco headquarters after the deal with Elon Musk was closed.

They did not consult with or inform me.\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 28, 2022 As Kanye West's Twitter account was out of suspension, speculations have been rife that former US president Donald Trump may soon be back on the platform. In May, Elon Musk said Twitter would reverse its ban of Donald Trump if his purchase of the social media company goes through, signaling just how permissive the platform could become toward free speech under his ownership. Elon Musk had then said Twitter's ban of Trump following the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection at the US Capitol was a 'morally bad decision' and 'foolish in the extreme'. 'I think that was a mistake because it alienated a large part of the country and did not ultimately result in Donald Trump not having a voice,' said Musk, adding that he preferred temporary suspensions and other narrowly tailored punishments for content that is illegal or otherwise 'destructive to the world.' Donald Trump, an avid tweeter before he was banned, said Friday he was 'very happy that Twitter is now in sane hands' but promoted his own social media site, Truth Social, that he launched after being blocked from the more widely used platform. Trump was banned two days after the Jan. 6 attacks for a pair of tweets that the company said continued to cast doubts on the legitimacy of the presidential election and raised risks for the presidential inauguration that Trump said he would not be attending.

Elon Musk on Sunday confirmed that Twitter can soon expand or even get rid of the 280-character limit on the platform.Also Read - Elon Musk Asks Twitter Managers To Prepare Job Cut List: Reports Responding to a user who asked if we can get rid of character limits, or at least expand it, Elon Musk said: 'Absolutely'. Musk, who has acquired Twitter for $44 billion after a bitter battle, said in April this year that the micro-blogging platform needs long-form tweets which is 'way overdue'. Twitter currently allows people to post in 280 characters. Reacting to a follower's tweet thread, Musk said: 'My most immediate takeaway from this novella of a thread is that Twitter is way overdue for long form tweets!' Twitter launched 280 characters in November 2017 to all users in supported languages, including English. The company first announced the controversial plan to move beyond its traditional 140 characters in September 2017 with a small group of users. Several Twitter users had argued that 280 characters would make Twitter less readable as the platform's defining characteristic is the brevity of posts. However, Twitter's decision to double its character count from 140 to 280 characters did not dramatically change the length of Twitter posts. According to the company, Twitter is still a place for briefer thoughts. On Saturday, Elon Musk said Twitter users will soon be able to pick a version of the microblogging platform they like better, like a moving maturity ranking. 'Being able to select which version of Twitter you want is probably better, much as it would be for a movie maturity rating,' Elon Musk tweeted. Musk added: 'The rating of the tweet itself could be self-selected, then modified by user feedback'. In another post, Elon Musk said, 'Comedy is now legal on Twitter'.","country":"IN","author":"India.Com News Desk","link":"https://www.india.com/technology/elon-musk-twitter-character-limit-to-be-increased-elon-musk-has-this-to-say-5713219/","language":"en","media":"https://static.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/1368045-elon-musk-1.jpg","title":"Twitter's Character Limit To Be Increased?

The rally helped the meme coin cover some of its losses from $0.2878 on October 31, 2021, to $0.1009 on October 29, 2022, Coinmarketcap data showed. It is not the first time Elon Musk's actions have fueled Dogecoin's price momentum. In June 2022, Musk was sued for $258 billion in damages for allegedly running a pyramid scheme to support Dogecoin. So, why have Elon Musk's actions influenced Dogecoin's price? We explore some of his comments and the corresponding price movements of Dogecoin. Effects Of Elon Musk's Comments On Dogecoin Price \u25cf Last year, Elon Musk announced that people could buy Tesla and Starlink merchandise using Dogecoin. It led to a 17 per cent jump in Dogecoin's price. 'Tesla will make some merch (merchandise) buyable with Doge & see how it goes,' Musk Tweeted in January. \u25cf But not all Musk comments resulted in Dogecoin's price appreciation. For example, in a US comedy show in May 2021, Musk said that Dogecoin was a 'hustle' for him. The comments led to a 35 per cent drop in Dogecoin price. \u25cf In April 2021, Elon Musk tweeted that 'Doge Barking at the Moon'. His post triggered a sharp rally in Dogecoin price, up by 20 per cent in a single day. Musk also posted numerous other cryptic Tweets about Dogecoin, Bitcoin, etc., which led to price volatility of the cryptocurrencies. For example, in July 2022, Tesla Inc., in a letter to its shareholders, disclosed that it sold almost 75 per cent of its Bitcoin holdings, worth $936 million. Tesla, however, didn't reveal its Dogecoin holdings. Musk said that Tesla sold its Bitcoin at the time since it was concerned about the company's liquidity due to Covid-related shutdowns in China, The Verge reported. 'I'm getting a Shiba Inu #resistanceisfutile,' Musk Tweeted in May 2021. Working with Doge devs to improve system transaction efficiency. Potentially promising. \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 13, 2021 Musk also said he worked closely with Dogecoin developers to make Dogecoin more efficient. 'Working with Doge devs to improve system transaction efficiency. Potentially promising,' Tweeted Musk in May 2014. Like Bitcoin , Dogecoin works on the older proof of work consensus mechanism and requires participants to solve complicated computer equations for rewards. Dogecoin's closest rival is Shiba Inu, but it runs on the ERC-20 framework and is hence not a cryptocurrency; instead, it is a crypto token.","country":"IN","author":"Outlook

It is true that the first thing that Elon Musk did after taking over Twitter was to fire CEO Parag Agrawal along with three other top executives including legal executive Vijaya Gadde. Reports claimed that Musk is apparently running a cleaning drive at Twitter and earlier there were reports which said that Musk may fire up to 75% of Twitter workforce. Now, while the media is closely watching the new developments at Twitter Headquarters in San Francisco, pranksters thought it would be a good idea to cash in on this.

Of course, there will not be a Rahul Ligma or Danial Johnson in the list of fired employees at Twitter. Getting back to the prank, the guy named Rahul Ligma actually managed to get away with his so-called interview with journalists by saying things like 'It makes me worry about the future of our democracy\u2026 the future of celebrity conservatorship.

After taking ownership of the social media platform, he has gotten to work addressing everything from election censorship to looking into accounts being wrongfully accused of violating Twitter's rules. The new Chief Twit is well known for listening to the feedback received from his customers. The Tesla Cybertruck is a great example of this. So is allowing Tesla customers and shareholders to vote on the locations of Supercharging stations. He's listed to his fans and critics alike, either implementing ideas or addressing undue criticism head-on. It should come as no surprise that Elon Musk is doing the same for Twitter. 'Anyone suspended for minor & dubious reasons will be freed from Twitter jail,' he tweeted in response to Jordan Peterson's daughter Mikhailia Peterson, who asked if Elon could bring her father back onto the platform. Massimo, @Rainmaker1973, a very popular account that tweets about astronomy, engineering, and astronautics, shared that he hoped his account wasn't suspended since it had been blocked for 12 hours after a tweet about universe expansion was flagged for violating Twitter's rules. The violation was for 'nonconsensual nudity.' Elon Musk apologized to Massimo and said he was fixing the issue as fast as possible. Sorry about that. Fixing as fast as possible! \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 28, 2022 When a surge of racial slurs took place over the weekend, Elon Musk and Twitter took action. In response to a tweet by LeBron James, Elon Musk shared a thread written by Twitter's Head of Safety & Integrity, Yoel Roth, who said Twitter has 'taken action to ban the users involved in this trolling campaign.' He also promised that Twitter will continue working to address this in the coming days. In response to a Twitter user, Kerri Gray, Elon Musk affirmed that there will be an increase to the allowable length of videos so users can post longer videos. The Chief Twit also promised to investigate reports of election misinformation policing. 'I will look into this. Twitter should be even-handed, favoring neither side,' he said. When Senior Researcher for True North Centre, Cosmin Dzsurdzsa, suggested making Twitter have different game modes and pitched his idea, Elon Musk agreed that this idea made sense. Something like this makes sense \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 29, 2022 These are just a few of the things Elon Musk has done since taking on the role of Chief Twit and ownership of the platform.

There's a somewhat unexpected winner out of all of Elon Musk's dealings and takeover of Twitter this last week: It's Dogecoin. DOGE jumped in value on word of Elon Musk finishing up his acquisition of Twitter and the dog meme-based cryptocurrency crossed an over 60 percent rise in value over this last weekend.The rise in Dogecoin's value could be seen over on the CoinMarketCap website, as reported by CNBC. Where the value of Dogecoin could be seen jumping as much as 35 percent before traditional markets' close on Friday, it had risen even further over the weekend, hitting a high of $0.125 per unit. It was an over 60 percent increase prior to where DOGE's value was before the Twitter deal officially closed and Elon Musk finally had the reins of the platform.Regardless, DOGE value has often gone hand-in-hand with Elon Musk's successes, failures, or even mentioning of the cryptocurrency. He is, after all, allegedly invested in the currency. With Twitter being a major get for Musk (even if the price tag was $44 billion), an exciting future for Musk can be seen by many as an exciting future for Dogecoin,It will remain to be seen if Dogecoin can keep its current run of good fortune.

He has gotten himself into trouble on a couple of occasions with them too. Whether politically or just discussing fringe science, his episodes are always exciting. And some of them have soundbites most Rogan fans would never want to miss. One of these was on Joe Rogan Experience #1886 with Robert Kelly as guest. Here, Rogan and Kelly talked about alien encounters and weird events including Orson Welles' famous reading of War of the Worlds in 1913. They then discussed aliens that ended with Rogan talking about Elon Musk. When asked if he would have an alien on his podcast, Rogan said that he already had an alien on his show. 'I would 100% have an alien on the podcast. I think I have had an alien on, Elon, he's been on here three times,' Rogan said. 'He is not one of us.'

Joe Rogan and Elon Musk have an unlikely but very intriguing relationship. Musk has been on the show three times so far and at one time, he was also on the board of Endeavor, the company that owns the UFC. While he is no longer with Endeavor, Musk recently 'challenged' Vladimir Putin on Twitter to an MMA-style one-on-one fight. Rogan also commented on the fight and its possibilities on his podcast. Upon hearing that Musk had issued the challenge, Rogan called him up and offered to set up his training camp. On a hypothetical note, without the training, Rogan weighed in on Musk's chances against the Russian premier. He said Elon is a big guy at 6'2'. He's had a match with a sumo wrestler at one point and since he is smart, he may be able to pick up moves quickly and put them into play. Rogan commented that Putin is a black belt in Judo although he is smaller than Rogan and so, much smaller than Musk. Rogan rounded off his opinions by saying he would bet on Elon Musk in a fight between Musk and Putin. Whatever the outcome of this fight might be, we know that Elon Musk is a rich topic for Rogan and we will likely see him mention the tech innovator in the future.

Despite doubting his intentions multiple times to follow through with the USD 44 billion Twitter acquisition deal, Tesla CEO Elon Musk is now in charge of Twitter. Regarding the changes in content moderation policies, Musk wrote in a tweet that \"Twitter will be forming a content moderation council with widely diverse viewpoints. No major content decisions or account reinstatements will happen before that council convenes.\" In one of the first few changes, he purged the top executives of the company as soon as he closed the expected deal in which Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal and finance chief Ned Segal left the company's San Francisco headquarters.\u00a0 He also hinted that more changes to the status of accounts banned under previous leadership are to come in the early days of his leadership, according to The Hill. The Tesla CEO also instilled suspicion amongst social media users when he tweeted on his Twitter \"Let the good times roll\" shortly after he acquired the social media platform and closed the deal. Musk arrived at the Twitter headquarters earlier this week carrying a sink, and documented the event on Twitter, saying \"Entering Twitter HQ - let that sink in!\" and also updated his Twitter description to \"Chief Twit.\" He tweeted a video of him and described his visit as an experience that he was trying to \"sink in\" as the Tesla CEO has until the end of the week to either close the Twitter deal or face a trial. In April, Twitter accepted Musk's proposal to buy and take the social media service private. However, Musk soon began sowing doubt about his intentions to follow through with the agreement, alleging that the company failed to adequately disclose the number of spam and fake accounts on the service.Related Stories In July, in a surprising turn of events, Elon Musk who had long been showing his interest to buy Twitter terminated the deal. The Tesla CEO did so by alleging that Twitter violated their mutual purchase agreement by misrepresenting the number of spam and fake bot accounts on its platform. After Musk put out the deal termination announcement, the market saw a sharp decline. Later, Twitter sued Musk accusing him of using bots as a pretext to exit a deal.Again, last week, Musk confirmed that he will move forward with the Twitter buyout at the originally agreed price of USD 54.20 per share.\u00a0 However, the Twitter deal legal proceedings had been put on hold by a judge overseeing the dispute until October 28.
