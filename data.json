With a smaller workforce, Twitter's security woes could pile up. ReutersAlso read:\u00a0Elon Musk Heads To Twitter HQ With A Ceramic Sink, Changes Twitter Bio To 'Chief Twit'It's important to not forget that none of your direct messages (DMs) on Twitter are end-to-end encrypted, which means that someone with the right access might be able to read them.Twitter's privacy policy, too, states that the company \"may share, sell, or transfer information about you in connection with a merger, acquisition, sale of assets, or bankruptcy.\"\u00a0Can Elon Musk access your Twitter data?\u00a0While it's possible in theory, it would not be straightforward, as Andy Wu, a professor from Harvard Business School, told Vox.Twitter's team could refuse to fulfill Musk's data requests, if any. Then he'd be compelled to replace them, which would require him to go through the board of directors. It's already clear that Musk will install his own board immediately. ReutersAlso read:\u00a0Was Elon Musk Right? Internal Documents Show Twitter's Losing Its Heaviest UsersElon Musk's intent with each user's private data is unknown, and pieces will fall into place in a few weeks from now when the transfer of power is complete. In a Tweet, Musk said that he wants to make Twitter \"the most respected advertising platform in the world\" with \"advertising that is as relevant as possible to [users'] needs.\"In the end, if Elon Musk wants to see someone's personal data, \"he could probably do that,\" Wu said. One positive sign is Musk's interest in adding end-to-end encryption to Twitter DMs, making it impossible for anyone but the sender and receiver to see those messages.

      "summary": "After formally taking over Twitter, Elon Musk sacked top executives including CEO Parag Agrawal. Now, a series of alleged conversations between the Tesla CEO Elon Musk and top Twitter executives \u2013 founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey, former CEO Parag Agrawal and Bret Taylor- chair of Twitter's board of directors has appeared online. The alleged chat and email messages are shared by Internal Tech Emails on Twitter. Here's how things unfolded April 6, 2022 Elon Musk: I have a ton of ideas, but Imk if I'm pushing too hard. I just want Twitter to be maximum amazing. Parag Agrawal: I want to hear all the ideas - and I'll tell you which ones I'll make progress on vs. not. And why. Parag Agrawal: And in this phase \u2014 just good to spend as much time with you. + have my Product and Eng team talk to you to ingest information on both sides. Elon Musk: I would like to understand the technical details of the Twitter codebase. This will help me calibrate the dumbness of my suggestions. Elon Musk: I wrote heavy duty software for 20 years Parag Agrawal: I used to be CTO and have been in our codebase for a long time. Parag Agrawal: So I can answer many many of your questions. Elon Musk: I interface way better with engineers who are able to do hardcore programming than with program manager / MBA types of people. Parag Agrawal: in our next convo - treat me like an engineer instead of CEO and lets see where we get to. I'll know after that convo who might be the best engineer to connect you to. Elon Musk: Frankly, I hate doing mgmt stuff. I kinda don't think anyone should be the boss of anyone. But I love helping solve technical/product design problems. Elon Musk: You got it! However, things started to go sound after Musk tweeted \"Most of these 'top\" accounts tweet rarely and post very little content. Is Twitter dying?\" three days after the alleged conversation. Wondering what may have happened next? Read on April 9, 2022 Parag Agrawal: You are free to tweet \"is Twitter dying?\" or anything else about Twitter - but it's my responsibility to tell you that it's not helping me make Twitter better in the current context. Next time we speak, I'd like to you provide you perspective on the level of internal distraction right now and how it hurting our ability to do work. I hope the AMA will help people get to know you, to understand why you believe in Twitter, and to trust you - and I'd like the company to get to a place where we are more resilient and don't get distracted, but we aren't there right now. Elon Musk: What did you get done this week? Elon Musk: I'm not joining the board. This is a waste of time. Elon Musk: Will make an offer to take Twitter private. A day later, Bret Taylor \u2013 former chair of Twitter's board of directors acknowledged Musk's conversation with Parag and responded back saying: April 10, 2022 Bret Taylor: Acknowledging your text with Parag yesterday that you are declining to join the board. This will be reflected in our 8-K tomorrow. I've asked our team to share a draft with your family office today. I'm looking forward to speaking today. Elon Musk: Sounds good Elon Musk: It is better, in my opinion, to take Twitter private, restructure and return to the public markets once that is done. That was also Jack's view when I talked to him. The conversation continues on April 13, 2022 as: Elon Musk: After several days of deliberation \u2014 this is obviously a matter of serious gravity \u2014 I have decided to move forward with taking Twitter private. I will send you an offer letter tonight, which will be public in the morning. Happy to connect you with my team if you have any questions. Thanks, Elon Bret Taylor: Acknowledged Bret Taylor: Confirming I received your email. Also, please use going forward, my personal email. Elon Musk: Will do Musk then spoke to Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey saying he need his help to make things better at Twitter. April 26, 2022 Jack Dorsey: I want to make sure Parag is doing everything possible to build towards your goals until close. He is really great at getting things done when tasked with specific direction. Would it make sense for me you and him to get on a call to discuss next steps and get really clear on what's needed? He'd be able to move fast and clear then. Everyone is aligned and this will help even more. Elon Musk: Sure Jack Dorsey: great when is best for you? And please let me know where/if you want my help. I just want to make this amazing and feel bound to it Elon Musk: How about 7pm Central? Elon Musk: Your help would be much appreciated Elon Musk: I agreed with everything you said to me Jack Dorsey: Great! Will set up. I won't let this fail and will do whatever it takes. Its too critical to humanity. Elon Musk: Absolutely Elon Musk: You and I are in complete agreement. Parag is just moving far too slowly and trying to please people who will not be happy no matter what he does. Jack Dorsey: At least it became clear that you can't work together. That was clarifying. Elon Musk: Yeah It is probably after this that Musk may have made up his mind to bring changes he made at Twitter on his first day of taking charge.

      "summary": "Story highlights Twitter is now an Elon Musk company as he closes a $44 billion deal. Immediately after taking control, Elon Musk fired Twitter CEO Parag Agarawal. Agrawal, however, is a winner in the tussle as he forced Musk to complete the deal. After months of drama, some testy statements, a bit of trolling from Musk and the reveal of some juicy text messages, Elon Musk is finally closing his deal to purchase Twitter for some $44 billion. Now as he completed the deal, according to reports, Musk has already gone after the senior leadership of Twitter. It is well-known after the months-long saga that there is no love lost between Elon Musk and Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal. Musk also doesn't like other top leaders at Twitter, including the company's policy chief Vijaya Gadde and its CFO Ned Segal. So, all three have been fired, probably along with a few more. At first glance it looks like a \"win\" for Elon Musk, who has sparred -- almost in public with Gadde and privately with Agrawal -- with Twitter leadership since he launched his bid to get a stake in the company. But look closer and it is clear that it is not Musk but Agrawal who is the winner in this tussle. Sure, he is losing his job as the CEO of Twitter. But significantly, even as he loses something, he is gaining a lot because he has forced Elon Musk to go through a deal that is extremely lucrative for Twitter shareholders. Keep in mind that Agrawal has forced him to purchase Twitter even when Musk tried to walk away from the deal. Personally too, Agrawal is getting something out of his firing. When he became the CEO of Twitter last year in December, he did so with a clause in his contract that guaranteed him a severance fee of $42 million if Twitter asked him to go before one year was over. This is the money that Twitter, now an Elon Musk company, will pay to Agrawal. Musk forced to the deal table To understand why this is a win for Agrawal, one needs to look at what has happened in the Musk-Twitter saga since April. Once Elon Musk decided that he would not join the Twitter Board and instead acquire the company, it became clear that things were not cool with him and Agrawal. A few days later, when Musk launched his bid to purchase Twitter for $44 billion, a price that most felt was extremely generous and too good to pass, most people assumed that if Musk succeeded in getting Twitter then he would ask top executives to go. In other words, it was very clear that Agrawal would not have a place in the Twitter owned by Elon Musk. And it would have been very clear to Agrawal too. Yet, Agrawal as CEO of Twitter probably recognised that the price Musk was offering was too good and he threw his weight behind completing the deal. But once Twitter accepted Musk's offer, things started to unravel fast. With many experts weighing that Musk was overpaying for Twitter, as well as highlighting how Musk would find running this company a difficult preposition, Musk probably had second thoughts. He started talking about the problem of bots on Twitter and alleged that the company withheld information from him. Twitter denied the allegations. Yet, after a few weeks, Elon Musk unilaterally decided to terminate the deal. Parag Agrawal stays firm This is probably when Agrawal decided to hit back. Twitter defied Elon Musk and refused to terminate the deal from its side. At the same time, with Agrawal as its CEO, the company said that it would force Musk to go through the deal. No compromise at all. When the mutual agreements failed to materialise, Twitter filed a case against Musk, asking court to enforce the deal. In the end, it was the court and the spectre of a messy lawsuit that probably made Musk change his mind. Days after texts between Musk and others were filed in the court as Exhibit and then came out in public, Elon Musk changed his mind. He told the court that he would go through with the deal and that he was willing to pay the same $44 billion for the company, a price that most experts find extremely generous. The fact that Twitter management has virtually forced Elon Musk to pay an exorbitant amount of money for the company is a win in every possible way for Agrawal. And Parag Agrawal put every effort into enforcing the deal knowing well that as soon as Musk got the company he would be fired. But the CEO's post was not the prize here. The prize was the lucrative deal. Musk, realising that he was overpaying, tried to get out of it. He trolled and threw shades at Twitter, and its management. But Twitter and Agrawal remained focussed and didn't let him get out of the deal. This is the reason why they are the winners of this Musk-Twitter saga. Now after taking control of Twitter, Elon Musk is putting on a brave face. But reality is that he has been humbled in this corporate war.",

      "summary": "The most blockbuster deal of recent times, the Musk-Twitter deal reached its finale on Friday with Tesla chief coming out at the helm of the social media giant. It was nothing less than a dramatic television series. With the twists, turns, u-turns, a pinch of courtroom drama, it was definitely an action-packed one. It all started on Twitter, rolled out on Twitter and ended\u00a0on Twitter. Here are all the tweets that marked milestones in the USD 44 billion worth deal It all started in April when the Tesla boss revealed his majority stake in Twitter and became its majority shareholder. The Twitter board discussed then discussed the possibilities\u00a0and invited Musk to be on the board.\u00a0 On April 5, Twitter's then CEO Parag Agrawal tweeted I'm excited to share that we're appointing @elonmusk to our board! Through conversations with Elon in recent weeks, it became clear to us that he would bring great value to our Board.\u2014 Parag Agrawal (@paraga) April 5, 2022 I'm excited to share that we're appointing @elonmusk to our board! Through conversations with Elon in recent weeks, it became clear to us that he would bring great value to our Board.\u2014 Parag Agrawal (@paraga) April 5, 2022 Then, Musk began his due diligence. Most of these 'top' accounts tweet rarely and post very little content. Is Twitter dying? https://t.co/lj9rRXfDHE\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 9, 2022 Musk changed his mind and Agrawal took Twitter to confirm it. Elon has decided not to join our board. I sent a brief note to the company, sharing with you all here. pic.twitter.com/lfrXACavvk\u2014 Parag Agrawal (@paraga) April 11, 2022 The world's richest man moves to buy Twitter instead.Taking Twitter private at $54.20 should be up to shareholders, not the board\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 14, 2022 With initial resistance from company board and adoption of \u2018poison pill,' Musk and Twitter finally reached agreement, Twitter chairman Bret Taylor confirmed. The Twitter Board has reached an agreement with @ElonMusk https://t.co/CCZ6IV6Q7P\u2014 Bret Taylor (@btaylor) April 25, 2022 Musk moves on to devise a plan for Twitter indicating\u00a0towards reversal of\u00a0life bans that have been imposed on some users. He advocates for free speech. For Twitter to deserve public trust, it must be politically neutral, which effectively means upsetting the far right and the far left equally\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 27, 2022 The world's richest man came up with plans that he wants to implement post acquiring the microblogging site. If Twitter acquisition completes, company will be super focused on hardcore software engineering, design, infosec & server hardware https://t.co/m2HseK0TXl\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 6, 2022 And then came a doubt\u2026 If our twitter bid succeeds, we will defeat the spam bots or die trying!\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 21, 2022 And, then a u-turn! Twitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of usershttps://t.co/Y2t0QMuuyn\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 13, 2022 Musk expressed his contention and ended up violating an NDA. Any sensible random sampling process is fine. If many people independently get similar results for % of fake/spam/duplicate accounts, that will be telling.I picked 100 as the sample size number, because that is what Twitter uses to calculate <5% fake/spam/duplicate.\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 14, 2022 Twitter's Parag Agrawal gave a reply backed with figures and reasoning... Unfortunately, we don't believe that this specific estimation can be performed externally, given the critical need to use both public and private information (which we can't share). Externally, it's not even possible to know which accounts are counted as mDAUs on any given day.\u2014 Parag Agrawal (@paraga) May 16, 2022 But, Musk didn't seem to agree or believe. \ud83d\udca9\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 16, 2022 As Musk's intention to abandon the deal became clear, the Twitter board moved to the court. The Twitter Board is committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr. Musk and plans to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement. We are confident we will prevail in the Delaware Court of Chancery.\u2014 Bret Taylor (@btaylor) July 8, 2022 Tesla boss thought that he will get away with the deal....\u00a0 Yes. In the (hopefully unlikely) event that Twitter forces this deal to close *and* some equity partners don't come through, it is important to avoid an emergency sale of Tesla stock.\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 10, 2022 And, then came another u-turn Buying Twitter is an accelerant to creating X, the everything app\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 4, 2022 With a deadline set by court, the deal moves forward. Musk changed\u00a0his bio to \u2018Chief Twit' and posted a video of him carrying a sink Entering Twitter HQ \u2013 let that sink in! pic.twitter.com/D68z4K2wq7\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 26, 2022 Musk also tweeted a letter to Twitter's advertisers, confirming the speculations around completion of the takeover.

      "summary": "At first glance it may look like Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal has lost the fight with Elon Musk, who fired him immediately after buying Twitter. But look closer: Agrawal is actually the winner as he forced Musk to complete a $44 billion deal which Musk wanted to avoid. Illustration: Vani Gupta/IndiaToday By India Today Tech: After months of drama, some testy statements, a bit of trolling from Musk and the reveal of some juicy text messages, Elon Musk is finally closing his deal to purchase Twitter for some $44 billion. Now as he completed the deal, according to reports, Musk has already gone after the senior leadership of Twitter. It is well-known after the months-long saga that there is no love lost between Elon Musk and Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal. Musk also doesn't like other top leaders at Twitter, including the company's policy chief Vijaya Gadde and its CFO Ned Segal. So, all three have been fired, probably along with a few more. At first glance it looks like a \"win\" for Elon Musk, who has sparred -- almost in public with Gadde and privately with Agrawal -- with Twitter leadership since he launched his bid to get a stake in the company. But look closer and it is clear that it is not Musk but Agrawal who is the winner in this tussle. Sure, he is losing his job as the CEO of Twitter. But significantly, even as he loses something, he is gaining a lot because he has forced Elon Musk to go through a deal that is extremely lucrative for Twitter shareholders. Keep in mind that Agrawal has forced him to purchase Twitter even when Musk tried to walk away from the deal.Personally too, Agrawal is getting something out of his firing. When he became the CEO of Twitter last year in December, he did so with a clause in his contract that guaranteed him a severance fee of $42 million if Twitter asked him to go before one year was over. This is the money that Twitter, now an Elon Musk company, will pay to Agrawal.Musk forced to the deal table To understand why this is a win for Agrawal, one needs to look at what has happened in the Musk-Twitter saga since April.Once Elon Musk decided that he would not join the Twitter Board and instead acquire the company, it became clear that things were not cool with him and Agrawal. A few days later, when Musk launched his bid to purchase Twitter for $44 billion, a price that most felt was extremely generous and too good to pass, most people assumed that if Musk succeeded in getting Twitter then he would ask top executives to go. In other words, it was very clear that Agrawal would not have a place in the Twitter owned by Elon Musk. And it would have been very clear to Agrawal too.Yet, Agrawal as CEO of Twitter probably recognised that the price Musk was offering was too good and he threw his weight behind completing the deal.But once Twitter accepted Musk's offer, things started to unravel fast. With many experts weighing that Musk was overpaying for Twitter, as well as highlighting how Musk would find running this company a difficult preposition, Musk probably had second thoughts. He started talking about the problem of bots on Twitter and alleged that the company withheld information from him. Twitter denied the allegations. Yet, after a few weeks, Elon Musk unilaterally decided to terminate the deal.Parag Agrawal stays firm This is probably when Agrawal decided to hit back. Twitter defied Elon Musk and refused to terminate the deal from its side. At the same time, with Agrawal as its CEO, the company said that it would force Musk to go through the deal. No compromise at all. When the mutual agreements failed to materialise, Twitter filed a case against Musk, asking court to enforce the deal.In the end, it was the court and the spectre of a messy lawsuit that probably made Musk change his mind. Days after texts between Musk and others were filed in the court as Exhibit and then came out in public, Elon Musk changed his mind. He told the court that he would go through with the deal and that he was willing to pay the same $44 billion for the company, a price that most experts find extremely generous.The fact that Twitter management has virtually forced Elon Musk to pay an exorbitant amount of money for the company is a win in every possible way for Agrawal.And Parag Agrawal put every effort into enforcing the deal knowing well that as soon as Musk got the company he would be fired. But the CEO's post was not the prize here. The prize was the lucrative deal. Musk, realising that he was overpaying, tried to get out of it. He trolled and threw shades at Twitter, and its management. But Twitter and Agrawal remained focussed and didn't let him get out of the deal. This is the reason why they are the winners of this Musk-Twitter saga. Now after taking control of Twitter, Elon Musk is putting on a brave face. But reality is that he has been humbled in this corporate war. --- ENDS --- Edited By: Abhik SenguptaPublished On: Oct 28, 2022",

      "summary": "Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, has finally acquired Twitter for $44 billion, according to US media and a Twitter investor. Musk appeared to be referring to the agreement when he tweeted, 'The bird is liberated'. Musk's Tweet has created waves in the crypto world before, too. Here's a compilation of the top-10 crypto-related Tweets from Elon Musk. 1] Bitcoin Halt Tweet On May 13, 2022, Musk tweeted a statement about Tesla's plan to no longer accept Bitcoin payments. As an outcome, Bitcoin fell from $54,819 to $45,700, its lowest since March 1, 2021. Tesla & Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/YSswJmVZhP \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 12, 2021 2] DOGE Tweet In January 2021, Musk tweeted about DOGE, a meme coin. After the Tweet, the price of Dogecoin galloped over 300 per cent in four hours, before dropping to nearly half of its new high in the following couple of hours. pic.twitter.com/a6kmk0PEgM \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 28, 2021 3] Bitcoin Is Safe On December 20, 2022, Musk tweeted 'Bitcoin is my safe word' and 'Bitcoin is almost as bs as fiat money'. However, this did not have an impact on BTC prices at that time. Bitcoin is my safe word \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 20, 2020 4] One Word DOGE On the same day, Musk tweeted \u2018One Word: Doge.' Following this, some reports claimed that 'The average trading volume of DOGE/USDT in the 30 minutes before the incident was roughly $1,942 per minute, with an average of nine trades per minute. The average trading volume per minute in the 30 minutes following the Tweet was around $299,330, with 775 trades per minute.' One word: Doge \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 20, 2020 5] Survey For Bitcoin Just days before denouncing Bitcoin, Elon Musk surveyed his Twitter followers to find out whether Tesla would take DOGE as payment. This meme-inspired cryptocurrency first appeared in 2013 as a joke on social media. He improved the decision-making process by conducting a poll. Do you want Tesla to accept Doge? \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 11, 2021 6] Dogecoin Can Pay For Tesla Elon Musk tweeted on Friday, May 27, 2022 that Dogecoin could now be used to pay for official Tesla items, and that SpaceX would soon follow suit. He wrote in his Tweet, 'Tesla merch can be bought with DOGE, soon Spacex merch too.' The Tweet caused Dogecoin's price to surge for a few hours. Tesla merch can be bought with Doge, soon SpaceX merch too \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 27, 2022 7] Support for Dogecoin On June 19, 2022, Musk tweeted, 'I will keep supporting Dogecoin.' Notably, the Tesla CEO has been sued for $258 billion for allegedly running a pyramid scheme to support Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency that has recently acquired popularity among investors. I will keep supporting Dogecoin \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 19, 2022 8] McDonald's started accepting Dogecoin In January 2022, Musk said in a Tweet that he would eat a Happy Meal on TV if fast food giant McDonald's started accepting Dogecoin. Happy Meal is one of the prominent items on the McDonald's menu. This led to a spike of 9 per cent in the price of Dogecoin over the previous day. I will eat a happy meal on tv if @McDonalds accepts Dogecoin \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 25, 2022 9] Musk's Claims On Cryptocurrency. Musk stated on Twitter that, except for the 0.25 BTC that was given to him by a friend years ago, he 'literally' does not hold any cryptocurrencies. 'I literally own zero cryptocurrency, apart from 0.25 BTC that a friend sent me many years ago,' he tweeted. Not sure. I let @jack know, but it's still going. I literally own zero cryptocurrency, apart from .25 BTC that a friend sent me many years ago. \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 22, 2018 10] April Fool's Day The CEO of SpaceX tweeted on April 1, 2022 that his organisation would 'place a literal Dogecoin on the literal Moon.' A Dogecoin has not yet been delivered to the lunar surface. Therefore, it is safe to believe that the Tweet was just an innocent April Fool's joke. SpaceX is going to put a literal Dogecoin on the literal moon \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 1, 2021",

      "summary": "After much delay and controversies, Elon Musk on October 27 finally concluded the $44 billion deal to take over Twitter. This announcement comes after seven months of delay and when both parties were given an ultimatum to close the deal before October 28.\u00a0 Within a few hours of taking over the company, Elon Musk fired top officials, which included CEO Parag Agrawal, head of legal, policy and trust, Vijaya Gadde, chief financial officer Ned Segal and Twitter's general counsel, Sean Edgett. Following this news, several leaked conversations allegedly between Musk, (now former) Twitter CEO and co-founder Jack Dorsey have come out in the open which show that things were perhaps not well between them.\u00a0 Elon Musk, as per the leaked chats, had ideas so as to make the platform \u2018amazing'. He further mentioned that he wanted to understand the technical details of the Twitter codebase (by company engineers) which will help him calibrate his suggestions.\u00a0 Former Twitter CEO, Parag Agarwal can be seen insisting that Musk should consider him as an engineer and talk to him. Going through the conversation between Jack Dorsey and Elon Musk, it can be seen that the co-founder, Dorsey is trying to setup a meeting which will help everyone in working.\u00a0 Later, there were alleged texts exchanged between Jack Dorsey and Elon Musk, where Musk can be seen mentioning that 'Parag was moving very slow and he was trying to please people who will not be happy no matter what he does.' Here is the conversation which reportedly took place between Parag Agrawal and Elon Musk. To conclude, things between Elon Musk and Parag Agrawal started off on a good note but soon things took turn when Musk tweeted 'Most of the these 'top' accounts tweet rarely and post very little content.' Is Twitter dying?\u00a0 Elon Musk was to acquire Twitter seven months ago for $44 billion. The Tesla CEO closed the deal on October 27 one day prior to the deadline which was set by the court. Previously, there were rumours that Musk was planning to lay off about 75 percent of Twitter's staff to reduce the overall operation cost. However, he later quashed these rumours via his tweet.

The Twitter employees are due approximately $100 million in payouts. According to a report, as part of Elon Musk's deal with Twitter and the company's compensation programme, the Tesla CEO agreed to pay the employees in cash. The Twitter employees are now afraid that Elon Musk may lay them off before making the payouts, DealBook has learned. As soon as Elon Musk acquired Twitter in a $44 billion deal, the billionaire is said to have sacked four top executives of the microblogging site including CEO Parag Agrawal, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Ned Segal and legal affairs and policy chief Vijaya Gadde. Before the deal was finalised, Elon Musk had accused Parag Agrawal of misleading him and Twitter investors over the number of fake handles on the social media site. According to sources, CEO Parag Agrawal and CFO Ned Segal were 'escorted out\" of the social media company's San Francisco headquarters after the deal with Elon Musk was closed. According to the reports, Parag Agrawal, Ned Segal and Vijaya Gadde -- reportedly sacked soon after Elon Musk officially completed the takeover process -- are poised to collect more than $100 million in severance and payouts of previously granted equity awards. 'Parag Agrawal and Ned Segal were in Twitter's San Francisco headquarters when the deal closed and were escorted out,\" Reuters quoted sources as saying. The New York Times reported that 'at least one of the executives who was fired was escorted out of Twitter's office.\" According to the Bloomberg News calculations, Parag Agrawal, who became the Twitter CEO less than a year ago, is eligible to receive roughly $50 million or \u20b9412 crore in compensation.

      "summary": "New Delhi: Rapper Kanye West's Twitter profile, which was suspended over anti-semitic posts, appeared to be back, a day after Elon Musk took over the company. The Twitter account of rapper, known as Ye, faced suspension and his posts which were deemed as 'anti-semitic' were also removed from the platform.Also Read - Elon Musk Twitter Takeover: Top Executives Sacked, Are More Employees Losing Jobs? On October 8, Musk had tweeted, 'Welcome back to Twitter, my friend!'. Musk had welcomed Kanye West on Twitter after a hiatus of two years. Meanwhile, Elon Musk on Saturday clarified he had no hand in the restoration of Kanye West's Twitter account. In a tweet, Elon Musk said, 'Ye's account was restored by Twitter before the acquisition. They did not consult with or inform me.' Elon Musk on Kanye's Twitter account being restoredYe's account was restored by Twitter before the acquisition. They did not consult with or inform me.\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 28, 2022 As Kanye West's Twitter account was out of suspension, speculations have been rife that former US president Donald Trump may soon be back on the platform. In May, Elon Musk said Twitter would reverse its ban of Donald Trump if his purchase of the social media company goes through, signaling just how permissive the platform could become toward free speech under his ownership. Elon Musk had then said Twitter's ban of Trump following the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection at the US Capitol was a 'morally bad decision' and 'foolish in the extreme'. 'I think that was a mistake because it alienated a large part of the country and did not ultimately result in Donald Trump not having a voice,' said Musk, adding that he preferred temporary suspensions and other narrowly tailored punishments for content that is illegal or otherwise 'destructive to the world.' Donald Trump, an avid tweeter before he was banned, said Friday he was 'very happy that Twitter is now in sane hands' but promoted his own social media site, Truth Social, that he launched after being blocked from the more widely used platform. Trump was banned two days after the Jan. 6 attacks for a pair of tweets that the company said continued to cast doubts on the legitimacy of the presidential election and raised risks for the presidential inauguration that Trump said he would not be attending. Trump has repeatedly said that he will not return to Twitter even if his account is reinstated, though some allies wonder if he'll be able to resist as he moves closer to announcing another expected presidential campaign. Cut to the present. Elon Musk officially became Twitter boss. Hours after taking over Twitter, Elon Musk said no decisions on content or reinstating of accounts will be made until a 'content moderation council' is put in place.",

Former US President Donald Trump lauded Twitter's new ownership under billionaire Elon Musk I am very happy that Twitter will no longer be run by Radical Left Lunatics: Donald Trump Hours after news of Musk's takeover broke, a fake statement from Trump began circulating online Elon Musk TWITTER DEAL:\u00a0Former US President Donald Trump lauded Twitter's new ownership under billionaire Elon Musk on Friday (October 28). \"I am very happy that Twitter is now in sane hands, and will no longer be run by Radical Left Lunatics and Maniacs that truly hate our country,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post following Elon Musk's completed takeover. On Thursday (October 27), Musk fired a number of Twitter executives including CEO Parag Agrawal and Vijaya Gadde, Twitter's longtime head of legal, policy and trust, who was in charge of significant account decisions, including suspending Trump. The former president said Twitter \"must now work hard to rid itself of all of the bots and fake accounts that have hurt it so badly. It will be much smaller, but better.\" Elon Musk said that the social media company \"will be forming a content moderation council with widely diverse viewpoints.\"\u00a0 That means suspended accounts like those held by former President Donald Trump won't immediately return to Twitter. \"No major content decisions or account reinstatements will happen before that council convenes,\" Musk added. On Thursday, Musk wrote in a posted note to Twitter advertisers that \"Twitter obviously cannot become a free-for-all hellscape, where anything can be said with no consequences! In addition to adhering to the laws of the land, our platform must be warm and welcoming to all.\" Hours after news of Musk's takeover broke, a fake statement from Trump began circulating online. \"Congratulations to Elon Musk on his purchase of Twitter. Many people are saying that change was needed, as the old management was too concerned with the woke agenda,\" the fabricated statement read.Related Stories \"I have been told that my account will be back up and running on Monday- we will see. Happy to be able to engage with an African-American-owned business!\" In July, in a surprising turn of events, Elon Musk who had long been showing his interest to buy Twitter terminated the deal.\u00a0 The Tesla CEO did so by alleging that Twitter violated their mutual purchase agreement by misrepresenting the number of spam and fake bot accounts on its platform.After Musk put out the deal termination announcement, the market saw a sharp decline. Later, Twitter sued Musk accusing him of using bots as a pretext to exit a deal.\u00a0 (With ANI inputs)\u00a0 ALSO READ: Elon Musk takes over Twitter but where will he go from here?

      "summary": "New Delhi: Elon Musk, who took over Twitter, is looking to make some major changes in the functioning of the micro-blogging platform. Elon Musk on Sunday confirmed that Twitter can soon expand or even get rid of the 280-character limit on the platform.Also Read - Elon Musk Asks Twitter Managers To Prepare Job Cut List: Reports Responding to a user who asked if we can get rid of character limits, or at least expand it, Elon Musk said: 'Absolutely'. Musk, who has acquired Twitter for $44 billion after a bitter battle, said in April this year that the micro-blogging platform needs long-form tweets which is 'way overdue'. Twitter currently allows people to post in 280 characters. Reacting to a follower's tweet thread, Musk said: 'My most immediate takeaway from this novella of a thread is that Twitter is way overdue for long form tweets!' Twitter launched 280 characters in November 2017 to all users in supported languages, including English. The company first announced the controversial plan to move beyond its traditional 140 characters in September 2017 with a small group of users. Several Twitter users had argued that 280 characters would make Twitter less readable as the platform's defining characteristic is the brevity of posts. However, Twitter's decision to double its character count from 140 to 280 characters did not dramatically change the length of Twitter posts. According to the company, Twitter is still a place for briefer thoughts. On Saturday, Elon Musk said Twitter users will soon be able to pick a version of the microblogging platform they like better, like a moving maturity ranking. 'Being able to select which version of Twitter you want is probably better, much as it would be for a movie maturity rating,' Elon Musk tweeted. Musk added: 'The rating of the tweet itself could be self-selected, then modified by user feedback'. In another post, Elon Musk said, 'Comedy is now legal on Twitter'.",

      "summary": "Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter today marks the end of a nearly six month long saga between the world's richest person and the social media firm. Ever since Musk became the largest shareholder in Twitter and proposed to buy it, he did face resistance from the company, including Twitter adopting the poison pill strategy to sway away Musk.And that's not all. On numerous occasions, it was evident that Elon Musk and Twitter's (ex) CEO Parag Agrawal were often on loggerheads. ReutersThat is what didn't make Agarwal's firing by Musk a surprise for many. But if you are wondering what all rifts happened with these two this year amid the $44 billion takeover bid, let us refresh your memory with the numerous instances which showed that Musk and Agarwal didn't seem to be on good terms.Agrawal Warning About Edit Button PollIn April 2022, after it was revealed that Musk has bought the majority stake in Twitter, the Tesla CEO had conducted a poll asking Twitterati if they want an edit button.\u00a0Do you want an edit button?\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 5, 2022Replying to this, Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal warned voters by stating that the consequences of Musk's poll will be important.

Please vote carefully. https://t.co/UDJIvznALB\u2014 Parag Agrawal (@paraga) April 5, 2022Replacing Agrawal As Twitter Interim CEOIn early May 2022, various media reports revealed that Elon Musk wanted to become the CEO of Twitter. As Musk was getting closer to securing funds to ensure the deal goes through, he wanted to expand his CEO roster. Musk, who already is the CEO of Tesla, Boring Company and SpaceX, reportedly wanted to replace Parag as Twitter's interim CEO.However, later on in his first interaction with Twitter employees in June, Musk had said that he doesn't care about being CEO at Twitter. He said he cares about driving the product in a particular direction, but isn't too hung up on titles. inc42Also Read:\u00a0From Elon Musk To Mark Zuckerberg-Why Do The 'Rich CEOs' Take A $1 Salary?Musk & Agrawal's Spam Debate On TwitterAmid Musk's accusations of spam/fake accounts on Twitter and reports of him intending to become interim CEO of Twitter came out,Twitter CEO Agrawal had said on Twitter that measuring spam accounts was complicated because some are actually real humans even if they look like spam, and vice versa. Twitter also allows bots on the service, so simply setting up an automated account is not against the rules.But Musk was not impressed with Agrawal's response. He suggested calling users to verify their accounts, then Elon Musk simply replied to Agrawal with a poop emoji.Next month itself, in a letter to Twitter, Elon Musk threatened to cancel the $4 billion deal and accused the company of 'resisting and thwarting' his right to information about fake accounts on the platform. The Tesla CEO had called this a 'clear material breach' of the terms of their merger agreement.Elon Musk Challenges Parag Agrawal For A Public Debate ReutersAmid the $44 billion Twitter deal deadlock, Tesla CEO Elon Musk\u00a0had\u00a0challenged Twitter CEO, Parag Agrawal, to a public debate about the percentage of bots on the social media platform.\"Let him prove to the public that Twitter has <5%>I hereby challenge @paraga to a public debate about the Twitter bot percentage.

      "summary": "Dogecoin (DOGE) price rallied 15 per cent to $0.1009 on Saturday, days after Tesla chief Elon Musk acquired Twitter and fired its CEO Parag Agrawal from his post. The rally helped the meme coin cover some of its losses from $0.2878 on October 31, 2021, to $0.1009 on October 29, 2022, Coinmarketcap data showed. It is not the first time Elon Musk's actions have fueled Dogecoin's price momentum. In June 2022, Musk was sued for $258 billion in damages for allegedly running a pyramid scheme to support Dogecoin. So, why have Elon Musk's actions influenced Dogecoin's price? We explore some of his comments and the corresponding price movements of Dogecoin. Effects Of Elon Musk's Comments On Dogecoin Price \u25cf Last year, Elon Musk announced that people could buy Tesla and Starlink merchandise using Dogecoin. It led to a 17 per cent jump in Dogecoin's price. 'Tesla will make some merch (merchandise) buyable with Doge & see how it goes,' Musk Tweeted in January. \u25cf But not all Musk comments resulted in Dogecoin's price appreciation. For example, in a US comedy show in May 2021, Musk said that Dogecoin was a 'hustle' for him. The comments led to a 35 per cent drop in Dogecoin price. \u25cf In April 2021, Elon Musk tweeted that 'Doge Barking at the Moon'. His post triggered a sharp rally in Dogecoin price, up by 20 per cent in a single day. Musk also posted numerous other cryptic Tweets about Dogecoin, Bitcoin, etc., which led to price volatility of the cryptocurrencies. For example, in July 2022, Tesla Inc., in a letter to its shareholders, disclosed that it sold almost 75 per cent of its Bitcoin holdings, worth $936 million. Tesla, however, didn't reveal its Dogecoin holdings. Musk said that Tesla sold its Bitcoin at the time since it was concerned about the company's liquidity due to Covid-related shutdowns in China, The Verge reported. 'I'm getting a Shiba Inu #resistanceisfutile,' Musk Tweeted in May 2021. Working with Doge devs to improve system transaction efficiency. Potentially promising. \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 13, 2021 Musk also said he worked closely with Dogecoin developers to make Dogecoin more efficient. 'Working with Doge devs to improve system transaction efficiency. Potentially promising,' Tweeted Musk in May 2014. Like Bitcoin , Dogecoin works on the older proof of work consensus mechanism and requires participants to solve complicated computer equations for rewards. Dogecoin's closest rival is Shiba Inu, but it runs on the ERC-20 framework and is hence not a cryptocurrency; instead, it is a crypto token.",
